   <h2>Carefully Maintained</h2>

   <p>I am the original owner. After break-in with Honda GN-4 oil, I've used Shell Rotella
      T6 ever since with Engine Ice coolant. Valves have been checked twice. They
      were within specifications but some were adjusted to return them to the middle
      of the recommended range.</p>

   <p>All upgrades were done before the bike was ridden so the <b>sale includes these additional, original parts</b>,
      completely unused:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>Gas tank</li>
      <li>Exhaust</li>
      <li>Fork and shock springs</li>
      <li>Front and rear fenders</li>
      <li>Plastic side panels and fork protectors</li>
      <li>Headlight and cowling</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Reason for Selling</h2>
   <p>I love this bike for solo adventuring. I can ride single track with 250s or on
      the highway with bigger bikes. It’s all good.</p>
   <p>The one thing I can't do is bring a passenger. I'm finding I miss that ability.
      It's something I really enjoyed on previous bikes. If I could keep this and
      have something bigger too, I would. I've worked hard to make this the perfect
      setup. I hope it serves someone else as well as it has me.</p>
